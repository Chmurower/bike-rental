### Web application dedicated to handling and managing of bike rental service. 

With growing popularity of bicycle tourism and formation of many bikeparks scattered across hilly and mountainous regions of country, there's a need of affordable, 
accessible, simple and easy to deploy system of bike management and reservation. 

Basic idea is to use a fast, computationally non draining framework to create simple yet effective reservation system, that is easy to deploy in different clouds.
