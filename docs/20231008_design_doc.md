## Intro

*Why/Problem*
With growing popularity of bike tourism, there's a high demand for bike rental services.

Lots of rental companies have problems with managing their resources - bikes, calendar, maintentance.

*How*

We would like to create a cloud application, to allow ease of deployment and configuration, without dependency on costly bare-metal solution, with high availability through web service.

*What*

Creating an app for managing bike rental, with consinderation in bike classes, availability calendar and pricing.

## Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals**:
Applet that allows a categorization of bikes, with differentiation of:
*Mountain Bike
*Road Bike
*City-tourist Bike

Applet that allows checking whether given bike is available at required time,
with possibility of reservation by the person managing the bike rental.

Applet for managing the maintenance of bicycles.

**Non-Goals**:

Overly complicated solutions with too many options. The application is to be lightweight, without needless functions, easy to use.

## Proposed solution

Starting with high-level design, arch diagrams, screenshots, mockups,...

You might here also touch things, such as testing.
